#  Authentication:
-Authentication has been done using Firebase. Being able to authenticate our users securely, it offers a customized experience to them based on their interests and preferences. We ensure 
that they have no problems accessing their private data while using our app from multiple devices. The user can sign up or login using the login/signup page and get registered on our 
website.

#  Form submission:
-If the person needs help he/she can submit the form in the need help section and we will find a volunteer to help him/her with the task. The submitted data is stored on mongoDb and
can be retrieved later for further use. A mail is sent to the concerned user that his help has been accepted

#  Form history:
-The user can track the forms submitted by him in the past using the history button in the form history section. All the forms that have been submitted by the user will appear there and the user can easily look up for the things he got help for.

#  Form acceptance:
-The submitted forms are then transferred to the volunteers who help the people. They can then accept the request for help from anyone who requires help. A mail is sent to the user when a volunteer accepts the userâ€™s request.

#  Accepted form history:
-In the volunteer sections people whose requests have been accepted by the volunteer are displayed. This section will help in keeping a track of the requests accepted by the volunteer for 
help.

#  Form status:
-Form status is displayed in the history section itself inside each information card containing basic info. Whether the form was accepted or rejected is displayed on the card in the red 
so as to highlight its status.

to chatting with others, sharing one felling, socializing etc.

#  Dark mode:
-The website can also be viewed in the dark mode. The button on the top right corner of the website lets the user toggle between dark mode and light mode. Dark mode is intended to reduce blue light exposure and help with eye strain that comes with prolonged screen time.

#  Responsive:
-The website is responsive as well. The website can adapt itself to the screen size available and is therefore suitable for displaying on all sizes and resolutions of the screen.
